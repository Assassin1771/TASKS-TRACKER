Reflection
What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
What did you set out to build?
Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
What were some unexpected obstacles?
What tools did you use to implement this project?
This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.
Example: -->

The main aim of this project was to learn the basics of React JS and some other Javascript Libraries.
This is one of the my first projects, where I learned how to call an API and display JSON data on the website.
After making this project, using React JS, Javascript and some styling with CSS, I feel confident to make frontend user side websites
